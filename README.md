# Webapps

* HTTP methods: `GET` vs. `POST` vs "the others"
   * REST often uses three others: 	`PUT`,	`PATCH`,	`DELETE`
       * See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Relationship_between_URL_and_HTTP_methods>
   * Complete list of "the rest": <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods/http-methods.xhtml>

# Sparkjava

* A growing collection of resources here: <https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/spark_java/>
* Many of those were written by the M18 CS56 mentors

# Let's focus first on JSON, then MongoDB/MLab today

* You'll need a way to store data
* JSON is a convenient representation
* MongoDB is a NoSQL database: think of it as a "Dictionary/Hashtable in the Cloud"  (i.e. a key/value store).
* MongoDB is much easier to learn and understand quicky vs. SQL databases
